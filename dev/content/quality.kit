                        <p>We are stubbornly local and believe the best quality is right here in New England. We source
                            all of our wood from tree farms in Maine and our metal casting from New England Foundries.

                        <p>Our products are built to last a lifetime because we use ductile iron for our blades and
                            bronze alloy for our bolts. They are designed to withstand even the most demanding
                            woodworking tasks. </p>
