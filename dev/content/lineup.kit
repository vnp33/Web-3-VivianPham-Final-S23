                    <h2>Tenon Saw</h2>
                    <p>A tenon backsaw is a type of backsaw that is specifically designed for cutting tenon joints. It
                        typically has a stiffened blade with a relatively fine tooth pitch, allowing for precise cuts
                        and a smooth finish. The blade is also narrower and taller than that of a standard backsaw,
                        making it easier to control when cutting into the joint.</p>

                    <h2>Dovetail Back Saw</h2>
                    <p>A dovetail backsaw is a type of backsaw that is specifically designed for cutting dovetail joints. It
                        is similar in design to a tenon backsaw, but with a smaller blade and finer teeth. This allows for
                        precise and clean cuts, which are necessary for creating the tight-fitting, interlocking joints that
                        are characteristic of dovetail joinery.</p>

                    <h2>Carcass Back Saw</h2>
                    <p>A carcass back saw is a type of backsaw that is designed for making precise and accurate cuts in
                        thick, dense materials, such as timber framing, door frames, and cabinet carcasses. It is
                        similar in design to other backsaws, but with a wider and deeper blade that can handle the
                        tougher cutting tasks associated with these types of projects.</p>
